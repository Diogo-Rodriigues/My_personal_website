          I'm a Master's student in Informatics/Software Engineering at the University of Minho, specializing in "Cryptography and Cybersecurity", and "Inteligent Systems" (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning). I like to think I work at the crossroads of Software Engineering, AI/ML, and Information Security, building systems that are not only smart and scalable, but also hard to break (for attackers, not for me 😅).

          I aim to grow at the intersection of these fields, exploring topics such as Application Security, Penetration Testing, Threat Modeling, Secure Software Development, AI Security, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Science and DevOps. If a challenge mixes algorithms, design, security, and creativity, chances are I'll want to dive right into it.
