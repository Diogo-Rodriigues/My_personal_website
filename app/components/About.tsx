        <p className="text-xl text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">
        I have always been passionate about physics and engineering, so I decided to combine the two and enrolled in a degree program in Engineering Physics. I am currently in my last year with an average of 16 and throughout the course, I developed a passion for computer science and programming and since then, I have focused heavily on areas such as software development, cybersecurity, and AI/ML.
